friend2friend-p2p
=================

android app that does p2p networking with your friends that have the app. Uses a db of friends numbers that have signed up for the app. links them to the numbers in the user&#39;s phone. Connect direct through ip to tranfer files, video, app links, maybe even vid chat in the end.. This is my first repo. If this is ever finished I will put on the app market for free to all.
